# Why this specifically?
  This model is just the beginning of what I want to achieve in this space. While drafting ideas for a meaningful project in my present day, one topic kept coming to mind. Today, there is such a vast amount of information that is accessible to people. Text is the foundational piece of what creates ideas, thoughts, and opinions. 
  Over my lifetime, people have become more glued to their phones than ever before, and one issue that I have seen in my life is the personalization of media. As tech has grown, companies' abilities to formulate personalized feeds pushed people into information silos. This has caused people to be sucked into reading information that might be biased. 
  The issue does not lie with the idea that they are reading about topics they have engaged with; it's the idea that they have started to stop understanding the bias that may come with the information they read. People have come to trust the information they have access to because they have been led to believe this is true. To help aid this issue, we need to make people aware of the bias they read online.
